# PracticeRecorder
An honors project for my Advanced Object-Oriented Programming class of Fall 2018.

This simple program allows you to record a practice session, letting you choose to add a number of 
activities within the session, and for how long you practiced them. It also allows you to create your own activity to log.
You may then view all past recorded practice sessions.

Because the methods used to access XML files for the data storage were depreciated in Java 9, the program runs on Java 8.
